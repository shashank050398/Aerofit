product recommendations and marketing strategies.

**Target Metrics**: Understand customer demographics and behaviors related to treadmill purchases, compute conditional and marginal
probabilities, and create customer profiles for each product.

**Approach**: Imported and analyzed customer purchase data. Conducted descriptive analytics to profile customers based on age,
gender, income, and other attributes. Constructed two-way contingency tables and calculated conditional and marginal probabilities.
Performed univariate and bivariate analyses using histograms, boxplots, and heatmaps to explore relationships between customer
features and product choice.

**Metrics Achieved**: Identified key customer segments for each treadmill model, calculated probabilities of purchasing different products
based on customer characteristics.

**Insights and Recommendations**: KP781 is favored by higher-income, older, and more frequent users. KP281 is popular among
younger and lower-income customers. Recommended targeted marketing for KP781 towards affluent and committed users, and
promotions for KP281 to attract younger customers. Improved customer segmentation can help in optimizing product offerings and
